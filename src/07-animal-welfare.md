  ## Pet ownership

    Certain creatures exhibit features of neoteny, beauty, playfulness, and loyalty. Humans have decided that it is their right to own such creatures and breed them. Pets, as opposed to other domesticated animals, like service dogs, are a luxury expense that redirects the socially useful desires for parenthood and companionship towards such creatures. Pets are not capable of advancing human civilization or even caring for themselves, but are capable of being intentionally or unintentionally mistreated. Thus, the costs and risks of having them are high, but the potential benefits are low by comparison to the types of activities they are substituting for.

    -Ban for-profit pet breeding
    -Mandatory spaying/neutering of cats and dogs like in Los Angeles
      -Animal shelters by law must perform this procedure if necessary
