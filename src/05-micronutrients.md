# Healthcare

    Simultaneously attack the various layers of artificial scarcity and protectionism in healthcare:

      -Break up the geographic hospital monopolies by allowing competition within their turf
      -Break up regional insurance monopolies, and allow selling across state lines
      -Allow importing drugs from overseas
      -Give consumer groups like AARP and March of Dimes a huge say in the licensing requirements for medical professionals
      -Mandate the use of a free and open source medical record standard
      -Loosen up the restrictions against small medical clinics and minute clinics.
      -Switch much of healthcare research funding into prizes for public domain research, free of royalties
